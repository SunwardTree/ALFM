## Note

The first author Zhiyong Cheng decided to extend the work to top-n recommendation, this is the main reason that I initiated this repo. However, he now is too busy to push this work. This means the update under this directory may be blank for a long long time.

I hided this note here to avoid being found by him. Please do not let him know and I'm willing to provide help for A3NCF of rating prediction.
